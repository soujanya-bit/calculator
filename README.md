# Calculator Project

A simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is designed as part of learning JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Clear the display using the "Clear" button.
- Handles input using interactive buttons for numbers and operators.
- Displays results in a user-friendly interface.
- Displays error messages for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the calculator.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the calculator.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for operations and dynamic functionality.

2. **Open the project**:  
   Open `index.html` in your browser to view and use the calculator.

3. **Perform Calculations**:
   - Click on the number buttons to input numbers.
   - Select an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
   - Enter the second number and click `=` to view the result.
   - Press the "Clear" button to reset the calculator.

## Known Issues

- Does not support continuous calculations without clearing (e.g., `3 + 2 * 5` needs manual intermediate steps).
- Only supports basic arithmetic; no advanced functions (like square root, exponentiation, etc.).

---

## Future Improvements

- Add support for chaining operations (e.g., `3 + 2 * 5`).
- Include additional mathematical functions like square root, power, and percentage.
- Enhance UI/UX with animations and responsive design.
